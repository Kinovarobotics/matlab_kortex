|   57   | CONTROL_ACTUATOR_COUNT_MISMATCH |  Number of constraint sent does not correspond to number of actuator (ex: joint speed) |
|   58   | CONTROL_INVALID_DURATION |  Duration constraint is too short. The robot would need out of limit speeds/accelerations to reach this duration. |
|   59   | CONTROL_INVALID_SPEED |  Speed constraint is negative |
|   60   | CONTROL_LARGE_SPEED |  Speed constraint is too high (exceed speed limit of leads to high acceleration) |
|   61   | CONTROL_INVALID_ACCELERATION |  Speed constraint is too high or duration constraint too short and leads to high acceleration |

|   63   | CONTROL_LARGE_SIZE |  Duration of the trajectory is more than 100s. The length of the trajectory is limited to 100000 points to avoid saturating the base memory. |

|   68   | CONTROL_ALREADY_RUNNING |  Trajectory is already running |
|   69   | CONTROL_WRONG_STARTING_POINT |  Robot is not on the first point of the trajectory when we try to start the trajectory. This can happen if there is a motion between the moment when trajectory is computed and when it is started. |
|   70   | CONTROL_CARTESIAN_CANNOT_START |  Cannot start |
|   71   | CONTROL_UNDEFINED_CONSTRAINT |  Kontrol library is not initialized |
|   72   | CONTROL_UNINITIALIZED |  Contraint sent is not defined |
|   73   | CONTROL_NO_ACTION |  Action does not exist |
|   74   | CONTROL_UNDEFINED |  Undefined error |
|   75   | WRONG_SERVOING_MODE |  Robot is in not in the right servoing mode |
|   76   | CONTROL_WRONG_STARTING_SPEED |  Robot is not at the right speed when starting a new trajectory. |

|   106   | PASSWORD_NOT_CHANGED |  Change password both passwords are the same |
|   107   | MAXIMUM_USER_PROFILES_USED |  Maximum number of user profiles in use |
|   108   | ROUTER_UNVAILABLE |  The client router is currently unavailable. This can happen if an API method is called after the router has been deactivated via the method SetActivationStatus. |
|   120   | ADDRESS_NOT_IN_VALID_RANGE |  IP Address not valid against netmask |
|   130   | SESSION_NOT_IN_CONTROL |  Trying to perform command from a non-controlling session in single-level mode |
|   131   | METHOD_TIMEOUT |  Timeout occured during method execution |
|   132   | UNSUPPORTED_ROBOT_CONFIGURATION |  Product Configuration setter method failed because changing this parameter is unsupported on your robot model |
